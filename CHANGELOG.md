## [0.1.2] - 2025-12-09

### Changed

- Renamed binary from `gf` to `gravityfile` (with `grav` alias) to avoid conflict with git-fetch

## [0.1.1] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- **Interactive TUI** - Terminal interface with vim-style navigation (`j`/`k`, `h`/`l`, `g`/`G`)
- **Parallel Scanning** - Fast directory traversal using `jwalk` for efficient multi-threaded scanning
- **Duplicate Detection** - Three-phase algorithm using BLAKE3 hashing:
  - Phase 1: Group files by size
  - Phase 2: Partial hash (first + last 4KB) for quick filtering
  - Phase 3: Full hash for candidate verification
- **Age Analysis** - Identify stale directories and analyze file age distribution
- **Drill-Down Navigation** - Explore directories without rescanning; maintains expansion state
- **Command Palette** - Vim-style `:` commands (`:cd`, `:root`, `:theme`, `:help`, `:q`)
- **Multiple Themes** - Dark and light theme support with semantic color palette
- **Export Support** - Export scan results to JSON format
- **Library-First Design** - Modular crate structure for use as a library:
  - `gravityfile-core` - Core types (FileNode, FileTree)
  - `gravityfile-scan` - File system scanning engine
  - `gravityfile-analyze` - Analysis algorithms (duplicates, age)
  - `gravityfile-tui` - Terminal user interface

### CLI Commands

- `gravityfile [PATH]` - Launch interactive TUI (default)
- `gravityfile scan [PATH]` - Quick disk usage summary with tree output
- `gravityfile duplicates [PATH]` - Find duplicate files
- `gravityfile age [PATH]` - Analyze file ages
- `gravityfile export [PATH]` - Export scan results to JSON
